giveoutsidevalues.m
This file generates temperature outside the domain to investigate extrapolating capability.
(The file saves the movie as it generates the data!)


generateMovie.m
This file generates temperatures and saves the movie as it generates the data!


trainsteady.m
(for steady case)
Casting the data in to be fed into nntool of MATLAB.
Also generates Train-Validation-Test sets and plots the results. 

trainUNsteady.m
(for unsteady case)
Casting the data in to be fed into nntool of MATLAB.
Also generates Train-Validation-Test sets and plots the results. (Many!)


square.m
Auto-generated mFile from PDEtool in case you cannot run the given data (.mat)


PCA.m
This file studies singular values and plots them to show data redundancy!
 

myNeuralNetworkFunction1.m
myNeuralNetworkFunction2.m
myNeuralNetworkFunction3.m
myNeuralNetworkFunction4.m
Some of my models: Generated ANNs. to run some of the codes and do plots you need them!



plotsquare.m
This file generates the plots related to the total data for training.

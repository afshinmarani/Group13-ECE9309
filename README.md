# Group13-ECE9309
This repositary is created for the purpose of uploading the project datasets and codes for the course ECE9309: Machine Learning, From Theories to Application (Winter 2019, Western University of Ontario).

Contributions:
Afshin Shaygani: Dataset generation (transient Heat equation coded in MATLAB), Neural Networks using MatLab.
Afshin Marani and Zahra Mohammadi: Contribution towards applying the tree-based ensembles on the same dataset, particularly random forest regression and gradient boosting regression, and consequently tuning. Implementation of such ensembles (random forest and gradient boosting) on the second dataset (practical approach dataset) prepared by Afshin Marani.
